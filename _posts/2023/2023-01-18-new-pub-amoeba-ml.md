ðŸŽ‰I'm happy to see this paper published titled "Workshop on Computer Vision for Bioanalytical Chemists: Classification and Detection of Amoebae Using Optical Microscopy Image Analysis with Machine Learning", here is the hyperlink, [Workshop on Computer Vision for Bioanalytical Chemists: Classification and Detection of Amoebae Using Optical Microscopy Image Analysis with Machine Learning](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jchemed.2c00631). It finally released in **Journal of Chemical Education** journal published by the Division of Chemical Education of the American Chemical Society.

Below is the abstract of our paper:   
> **Abstract**  
Computer vision (CV) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that trains computers to understand our visual world based on digital images. There are many successful applications of CV including face and hand gesture detection, weather recording, smart farming, and self-driving cars. Recent advances in computer vision with machine learning (ML) provide a new avenue for microbiological analysis. ML has been proven efficient and precise due to its automatic analysis of the geometric features and texture of organisms in optical microscopy images. This work describes a workshop that teaches basics of CV using ML (image classification, object detection) using Python notebook examples in Google Colab and Jetson Nano. The workshop is designed for senior undergraduate or beginning graduate chemistry students who would like to learn how to classify and detect microorganisms such as amoebae. The workshop content includes three sections: image classification with convolutional neutral netowork (CNN) in Google Colab, object detection with Mask R-CNN in Google Colab, and object detection with SSD-mobilenet in Jetson Nano.

I also shared the happiness to LinkIn post, and here is the hyperlink, [LinkedIn: New publication in Journal of Chemical Education](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/baosen-zhang-bz27_workshop-on-computer-vision-for-bioanalytical-activity-7021876032903282688-DVPU?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).  

This paper is a workshop mainly teach the image classification and detection using different platforms. However, this work can be extended. For example, we tried to make it as a biological sensor. We made a prototype as demonstration in the video, [simple demo of amoeba detection](https://github.com/BaosenZ/amoeba-video-detection/blob/master/output-video/detect-amoeba.mp4){:target="_blank"}. ðŸ¤‘We used it to get a funding from National Science Foundation Innovation Corps (NSF I-Corps) sites program in Summer 2021. I decribed more about this program in another blog post (Hyperlink: [New Certificate - NSF Innovation Corps Sites Program Summer 2021](https://baosenz.github.io/posts/new-cert-Icorp/)).
