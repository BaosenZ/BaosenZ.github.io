Welcome to my first blog post using the Chirpy Jekyll theme! ðŸš€

## Getting Started

This is a test post to explore how Chirpy renders content. Below are some features you can use in your posts:

### Markdown Example
You can write **bold text**, *italic text*, or `inline code`. Here's a list:

- Point 1
- Point 2
  - Sub-point 2.1
  - Sub-point 2.2

### Code Block
```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, Chirpy!")
```

### Adding an Image
Hereâ€™s an image example (make sure the file exists in assets/img/posts/):

## Conclusion
Thatâ€™s it for this test post! You can customize Chirpy and add more features as needed. Happy blogging! ðŸŽ‰
