ðŸŽ‰Our group collaborated with Dr. Christopher Ziegler's group published paper about pyridinium ferrocene aqueous redox flow battery (ARFB) in the [Journal of Organometallic Chemistry titled "Pyridinium ferrocene sulfonate salts: Highly soluble materials for electrochemical applications"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jorganchem.2023.122695). This is also my fourth ferrocene-based ARFB paper. We gradually revealed what is the better ferrocene chemical structure for ARFB applications. 

Here are all our ferrocene-based ARFB papers, which exhibit our understanding of this type of ARFB materials: 
1. [Investigations into aqueous redox flow batteries based on ferrocene bisulfonate](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsaem.0c02259)
2. [Highly Soluble Imidazolium Ferrocene Bis(sulfonate) Salts for Redox Flow Battery Applications](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.1c01473)
3. [Pyridinium ferrocene sulfonate salts: Highly soluble materials for electrochemical applications](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jorganchem.2023.122695)
