ðŸŽ‰I'm happy to see this paper published titled "Polymer bead size revealed via neural network analysis of single-entity electrochemical data", here is the hyperlink, [Polymer bead size revealed via neural network analysis of single-entity electrochemical data](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2024/an/d4an00670d). I saw this idea coming out with just simple drawing in the white board, became mature, and finally released in **Analyst** journal published by the Royal Society of Chemistry. 

Below is the abstract of our paper:   
> **Abstract**  
Single-entity electrochemistry methods for detecting polymer microbeads offer a promising approach to analyzing microplastics. However, conventional methods for determining microparticle size face challenges due to non-uniform current distribution across the surface of a sensing disk microelectrode. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of neural network (NN) analysis for extracting the size information from single-entity electrochemical data (current steps). We developed fully connected regression NN models capable of predicting microparticle radii based on experimental parameters and currentâ€“time data. Once trained, the models provide near-real-time predictions with good accuracy for microparticles of the same size, as well as the average size of two different-sized microparticles in solution. Potential future applications include analyzing various bioparticles, such as viruses and bacteria of different sizes and shapes.
